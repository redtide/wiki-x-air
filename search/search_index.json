We generally recommend using the DHCP mode, unless you have a very specific reason to set it up manually.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note: Changing parameters of the currently selected connection mode will disconnect the software from the console.

LO CONTOUR adjusts the level of phase-corrected low frequencies and PROCESS adjusts the level of phase-corrected high frequencies. GAIN compensates for level changes caused by the effect.</p>"},{"location":"en/10_-_effect_descriptions/#guitar-amp","title":"Guitar Amp","text":"<p>Modeled after the Tech 21 SansAmp, the Stereo / Dual Guitar Amp simulates the sound of plugging into a real guitar amp. From shimmering cleans to saturated crunch, the Stereo / Dual Guitar Amp allows an electric guitar player to sound great without using an amp on stage.</p> <p>The PREAMP knob adjusts the amount of input gain prior to the band-specific distortion adjustment. BUZZ adjusts the low-end breakup, PUNCH adjusts the midrange distortion, and CRUNCH tailors the high-frequency content and distortion for smooth or cutting notes. The DRIVE knob simulates the amount of power amp distortion from a tube amp. The LOW and HIGH knobs allow EQ adjustment independent of distortion content, and the overall output is controlled by the LEVEL knob. The CABINET simulation can be bypassed if the guitarist is already using a real cab, which allows the effect to function like a boost or distortion pedal. The Dual Guitar Amp allows the left and right channels to be adjusted independently.</p>"},{"location":"en/10_-_effect_descriptions/#tube-stage","title":"Tube Stage","text":"<p>Tube Stage/Overdrive is a versatile effect capable of emulating a variety of modern and classic tube preamps. Available in stereo and dual-mono versions, use Tube Stage/Overdrive to dial in warm and fuzzy sounds from subtle to fully saturated.</p> <p>DRIVE adjusts the amount of harmonics being driven by the effect. EVEN and ODD adjust the amount of even and odd harmonics. GAIN adjusts the output gain of the effect. LO CUT sets the input frequency below which the source signal will not pass through the effect. HI CUT sets the input frequency above which the input signal will not pass through the effect. BASS GAIN/FREQ adjust a low shelving filter at the output of the effect. TREBLE GAIN/FREQ adjust a high shelving filter at the output of the effect.</p>"},{"location":"en/10_-_effect_descriptions/#stereo-dual-pitch","title":"Stereo / Dual Pitch","text":"<p>Pitch shifting is often used in two different ways. One is to set the Mix knob lower and only use the Cent knob to make a small off set in pitch between the wet and dry tones. This results in a \u201cvoice doubling\u201d effect that thickens the overall sound in a more subtle way. The extreme use of the effect is to turn the Mix knob fully clockwise so the entire signal is effected. This way, the signal can be shifted into other keys up to an octave above or below the original. When used on a voice, this results in a \u201cchipmunk\u201d sound or a low Darth Vader effect.</p> <p>When the SEMI and CENT knobs are set at 12:00, the pitch is not altered. Making adjustments by semitone will have a very pronounced effect, whereas changes to the CENT knob will be very minor. The DELAY knob creates a time difference between the wet and dry sound. The LO and HI CUT knobs allow the effected signal to be band-limited. The Dual Pitch effect allows the left and right channels to be adjusted independently, and allows GAIN compensation and panning of the two channels.</p>"},{"location":"en/11_-_instructional_videos/","title":"11.
