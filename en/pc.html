						<h1>7. X AIR for PC</h1>
<p>The X AIR applications for iOS, Android and Windows/Mac/Linux allow all of the
physical controls and features normally found on analog mixers to be adjusted
digitally, and also allow effects and routing to be fully adjusted, all from a
remote location away from the input box. This results in a very compact, yet
full-featured mixing solution that can be operated while moving about the venue
or studio. This chapter will discuss the software’s functionality
on a laptop/desktop running Windows, OS X or Linux.</p>

<h3 id="77-sends-tab">7.7 Sends Tab</h3>

<p><img src="/wiki-x-air/assets/img/x-air_manual/pc/PC_sends_tab.png" alt="Sends Tab Image" /></p>

<p>The Sends tab allows the currently-selected channel’s signal to be routed
to the 6 Aux buses and to the 4 FX processors. These adjustments can also
be made on the Channel tab, or by selecting one of the Fader Bank layers
on the lower right-hand side of the main view screen.
The signal can be routed to the buses from specific points in the preamp chain,
such as pre or post EQ and pre or post fader. Clicking the globe icon will
enable changes to the tap point (pre/post fader, etc) to take effect
on all channels.</p>

<h3 id="78-main-tab">7.8 Main Tab</h3>

<p><img src="/wiki-x-air/assets/img/x-air_manual/pc/PC_main_tab.png" alt="Main Tab Image" /></p>

<p>All of the controls on the Main tab are also accessible from the Channel tab.
The channel’s signal can be unassigned from the main output, which is useful
when recording sources that aren’t meant to be heard by the audience,
or for sources such as click tracks that are only meant for
the performers’ mixes and not the main speakers. The channel’s pan control can
be adjusted and DCA, Mute Group and Auto Mix assignments can be made as well.</p>

<h3 id="79-fx-tab">7.9 FX Tab</h3>

<p><img src="/wiki-x-air/assets/img/x-air_manual/pc/PC_FX_tab.png" alt="FX Tab Image" /></p>

<p>The FX tab has 4 effect processors that can be routed and adjusted to various
channels and buses. A new effect can be selected by clicking the pull-down menu
where the current effect’s name is displayed, or by clicking the Type button
which also shows a graphic view of each effect. Once a desired effect is selected,
click on the graphic to bring up the edit window where the specific parameters
can be adjusted. If applicable, a tap tempo button is available to manually enter
the rate of delays or choruses. The button will flash to indicate the tempo.
Click the Insert button to engage the effect as an insert instead of side-chain.
Select the channel or bus assigned to the effect with the pull-down menu.
See the Effects Overview chapter for more details.</p>

<h3 id="710-meter-tab">7.10 Meter Tab</h3>

<p><img src="/wiki-x-air/assets/img/x-air_manual/pc/PC_meter_tab.png" alt="Meter Tab Image" /></p>

<p>The Meter tab allows easy monitoring of all analog and digital levels,
including USB channels, Buses, Ultranet outputs, and the Main and Solo buses.</p>

<h3 id="711-setup-menu">7.11 Setup Menu</h3>

<p>The Setup menu allows the wireless connection to be configured and allows
various global parameters to be selected and adjusted.</p>

<h5 id="connection-tab">Connection Tab</h5>

<p><img src="/wiki-x-air/assets/img/x-air_manual/pc/PC_setup_connection.png" alt="Connection Tab Image" /></p>

<p>After you connect your computer to the internal Access Point or external router,
the software will likely automatically recognize the mixer and ask to connect.
Once connected, a prompt will ask if you would like to transfer settings from
the mixer to PC, or from the PC to the mixer. Click ‘cancel’ if you don’t want
to sync settings. The Connection tab also allows you to manually assign
an IP address. If you have firmware 1.09 or later, you can update the firmware
directly from this screen as well.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong> - save your settings to your computer’s hard drive
before updating the firmware!</p>

<p>By default, a generic name, such as XR18-1B-10-F3, will be assigned to your mixer.
This can be changed to something more specific and recognizable. The console
can also be initialized back to its factory state, but be aware that all settings
will be erased. We highly recommend using the Save function to store any

<p><img src="/wiki-x-air/assets/img/x-air_manual/pc/PC_setup_access_wlan_lan.png" alt="Access Point, WLAN, LAN Tabs Image" /></p>

<p>The Access Point, WLAN and LAN tabs allow the wireless connection to be configured.
See the ‘Network Connection’ chapter for details.</p>

<h5 id="audiomidi-tab">Audio/MIDI Tab</h5>

<p><img src="/wiki-x-air/assets/img/x-air_manual/pc/PC_setup_audio_midi.png" alt="Audio/MIDI Tab Image" /></p>

<p>Activate the desired MIDI transmit and receive options for the physical MIDI
ports and the USB MIDI in the menu. Enabling DIN/USB Rx allows the XR to receive
MIDI commands via physical or USB connection. Enabling DIN/USB Tx allows the XR
to send MIDI data through physical or USB connection. USB-DIN Passthrough allows
USB MIDI commands to be sent through the MIDI OUT jack.</p>

<p>DIN/USB-OSC enables text based OSC commands to be received via MIDI Sysex,
either coming from USB or MIDI IN terminals.</p>

<p>Open Sound Control via Sysex F0 00 20 32 32 TEXT F7, with ‘TEXT’
being OSC strings in hex format, up to 39 kB in length.</p>

<p>Everything OSC related is described in our ‘PUBLIC PART OSC archive’ together
with the parameters text file, which is distributed with every firmware update.</p>

<p><a href="https://mail.music-group.com/OWA/redir.aspx?C=vFVI2197zEpnR1dm_1L7qvNYTA5qI0AUxs94Qk-dL81MIErER6rVCA..&amp;URL=https%3a%2f%2fconfluence.musictri.be%2fdownload%2fattachments%2f341054482%2fX-AIR_Remote-Control-Protocol_Rev2.zip%3fversion%3d1%26modificationDate%3d1472466936000%26api%3dv2">X-AIR_Remote-Control-Protocol_Rev2.zip</a></p>

<p>The OSC paths and parameter values of the message that you’d like to convey need
to be expressed as HEX Ascii characters one by one, including blanks and CR.
The block of Hex characters (i.e. 2 digits each) can be copied to the ‘TEXT’
in the Sysex string. This enables users to access many functions inside
the X-AIR mixer using standard MIDI transmission, for example, when running
a DAW project.</p>

<p>Example message “/ch/01/eq/on 1” corresponds to the bold TEXT portion
of the Sysex below, and it would switch the EQ in channel 1 on.</p>

<p>F0 00 20 32 32 2F 63 68 2F 30 31 2F 65 71 2F 6F 6E 20 31 F7</p>

<p>Note that all MIDI Config parameters should be unchecked in order for
the BEHRINGER X-TOUCH control surface to control the X-AIR mixer
via IP networks or MIDI.</p>

<p>The console can operate at 48 kHz or 44.1 kHz. Mute the main LR fader
before changing clock rates as pops can occur.</p>

<p>Engage the Safe Levels function to automatically mute the outputs during
a power cycle. This is particularly useful for situations where the mixer
is always connected to a PA system or monitoring setup.</p>

<p>The Link Preferences allow specific preamp elements to be synchronized
when adjacent channels are linked.</p>

<p>The console defaults to “soft mutes”, meaning that if a channel has been
specifically muted, and is also a part of a mute group, when the mute group
is unmuted, the channel that was specifically muted will also be unmuted.
Selecting Hard Mutes will cause a channel that has been muted with its dedicated
Mute button will remain muted even if a mute group to which it belongs is unmuted.
DCA Groups normally just control volume levels without actually having
audio routing through them. However, engaging DCA Groups in the Mute System
will enable channels to be muted via DCA group assignments.</p>

<p>The X18/XR18 has an 18x18 channel interface built-in, but sometimes
this is overkill for a recording session. For overdubs and simple tracking,
the 2x2 interface is more efficient and easier on processing power.</p>

<p>Various send (Tx) and receive (Rx) preferences are selectable
for the MIDI configuration.</p>

<h5 id="monitor-tab">Monitor Tab</h5>

<p><img src="/wiki-x-air/assets/img/x-air_manual/pc/PC_setup_monitor_2.png" alt="Monitor Tab Image" /></p>

<p>The monitor source defaults to the main LR (post-fader), but you can select
a bus, aux, USB 17/18 or a combination of buses. Soloed channels and buses
can be monitored pre or post-fader. PFL attenuation can be engaged and
the relative levels for monitor and source can be set. Click the DIM button
to enable dimming and select the attenuation level. The monitor bus can be set
to mono and can be muted from this page.</p>

<h5 id="preferences-tab">Preferences Tab</h5>

<p><img src="/wiki-x-air/assets/img/x-air_manual/pc/PC_setup_preferences.png" alt="Preferences Tab Image" /></p>

<p>Select the ‘Apply changes to all channels’ option if you would like changes
made to bus send taps (pre/post-EQ, etc) to be applied to all channels.</p>

<p>Auto Select options allow the last soloed channel to be selected automatically,
and allow a channel to be automatically selected whenever its fader is adjusted.</p>

<p>Exclusive solo mode allows only one source to be soloed at a time.
Pressing a channel’s Solo button will automatically un-solo previously
soloed channels.</p>

<p>The ‘Fine’ fader mode allows adjustments to the faders to occur more gradually,
allowing more precise control when making small changes.</p>

<p>The update rate defaults to 100%, meaning the meters and RTA display immediate
feedback of the audio signals. However, this can be adjusted to 50%,
which shows less detail but also conserves on processing power.</p>

<p>The configuration of the application’s windows can be stored and recalled
upon launch. Click the Initialize button to clear the stored window configuration.</p>

<p>Use the Always on Top selection to keep certain windows in view regardless
of other windows being adjusted.</p>

<h3 id="712-snapshot-page">7.12 Snapshot Page</h3>

<p>The snapshot function allows specific bits of information to be saved
for immediate recall. For example, quick changes can be selected
for different acts of a play, performances in a music festival
with several bands, or different church services.</p>

<p><img src="/wiki-x-air/assets/img/x-air_manual/pc/PC_snapshot_2.png" alt="Snapshot Page Image" /></p>

<p>Click the ‘Snapshots’ icon on the right hand side of the main screen.
A window will open with a list of parameters to select for recall.
You can select individual channels/parameters that will be recalled
from a previously saved snapshot, or click the ‘All’ button to choose everything
in a category. There may be channels, buses, parameters, etc. that should remain
unaffected throughout an event, so this method is beneficial
for its highly specific method of recall.</p>

<p>To save a snapshot, click one of the slots in the left-hand list.
A new entry will appear in the list where you can type in a name
for the new snapshot. Note that all aspects of the current arrangement
will be saved to a new snapshot slot, and the specific elements
of that snapshot can be selected upon recall.</p>

<p>The snapshots recall parameters are listed in 3 categories: channel,
parameter and global.</p>

<p>The Channel Section lets you determine which channels or bus masters
will be affected during recall.</p>

<p>The Parameter Section lets you determine which specific preamp elements
will be recalled for the channels and buses selected in the Channel Section above.
Source affects the input vs. USB selection, Input recalls basic preamp settings
such as phantom and gain setting, and Config recalls the configuration.
EQ, Dyn, Fdr/Pan and Mute recall these settings for the selected channels,
and the bus/FX sends can be individually assigned for recall.</p>

<p>Global Settings allow the input/output routing to be recalled,
as well as global configuration, DCA assignments, and FX block settings.</p>

<p>To delete a snapshot that is no longer necessary,
select it from the list and click Delete.</p>

<h3 id="713-utilities">7.13 Utilities</h3>

<p>Utilities offer convenient editing and customization of items that are not
easily controlled on other windows or menus.</p>

<h5 id="rta-utility">RTA Utility</h5>

<p><img src="/wiki-x-air/assets/img/x-air_manual/pc/PC_utility_RTA_3.png" alt="RTA Utility Image" /></p>

<p>The RTA utility allows customization of the appearance and functionality
of the real time analyzer. The RTA Source pull-down menu allows
a specific channel or bus to be fixed to the RTA, or the RTA can follow
the active channel. Select Solo Priority to send any soloed channel to the RTA.</p>

<p>The Decay adjustment controls how quickly the frequency bands fall
after reaching their initial indication. Peak Hold will leave a small marker
to indicate the peak measurement over a longer period of time
while still monitoring the fine audio activity. RTA Gain compensates
for audio levels, ensuring accurate readings. Select the Auto Gain feature
to automatically select an appropriate RTA gain level.
The EQ overlay adjustment controls the opacity of the RTA when viewing
channel EQ curves. Select Spectrograph to view the audio energy
across the spectrum, where blue represents lower levels and red indicates
higher levels. Note that this only affects the RTA utility window
and not the individual channel EQs.</p>

<p>Channel and Graphic EQs can be preassigned to have spectrograph RTAs,
and can operate as pre or post-EQ. These selections can be overridden
on the channel/bus EQ tab. Select the ‘Use RTA Source’ option
if you want to view a source’s RTA while adjusting another channel’s EQ.</p>

<p>Select a 30 or 60 dB gain range, and pre or post EQ results.
Select Peak to monitor the rapid changes in frequency response,
or RMS to view an average response over a longer period of time.</p>

<h5 id="buses-utility">Buses Utility</h5>

<p><img src="/wiki-x-air/assets/img/x-air_manual/pc/PC_utility_buses.png" alt="Buses Utility Image" /></p>

<p>The Buses utility window gives convenient access to all of the channel strip
functions of all 6 buses and the main LR at the same time. This window can be
left open so that changes can be made without having to select
individual buses in the main window.</p>

<h5 id="dca-utility">DCA Utility</h5>

<p><img src="/wiki-x-air/assets/img/x-air_manual/pc/PC_utility_DCAs.png" alt="DCA Utility Image" /></p>

<p>Similar to the Buses utility, the DCA utility window allows all 4 DCA groups
to be easily monitored and adjusted.</p>

<p>A custom set of channels, buses and/or DCA groups can also be configured
in 2 user-defined windows. This has the added feature of expanding the channel
strip to include the gain level, bus sends, and other information that
is normally visible in the mixer tab in the main window.</p>

<h3 id="714-auto-mix">7.14 Auto Mix</h3>

<p><img src="/wiki-x-air/assets/img/x-air_manual/pc/PC_auto_mix.png" alt="Auto Mix Image" /></p>

<p>The Auto Mix function is very useful for meetings or panel discussions
where multiple microphones are used for speech. The mic channels can be assigned
to one of two auto mix groups, which will automatically attenuate the channels
that are not currently receiving signal. Click the X or Y auto mix buttons
on the right side of the main window, then click the right-hand circle
just above each channel fader that you want to assign to the auto mix.
An X or Y will appear in the circle to indicate the assignment.</p>

<p>Whenever the auto mix bus is engaged, a blue gain reduction meter will indicate
the amount of signal reduction. This allows the current speaker to be heard
clearly while suppressing any noise from the other microphones. A white arrow
also appears next to each fader assigned to the auto mix bus,
which allows certain channels to be attenuated more or less to compensate
for louder voices or more sensitive microphones.</p>

<p>For situations when one person is speaking for extended periods of time,
it may be helpful to select the Last Gate box beneath the auto mix button.
This keeps the most recently active channel open, preventing unwanted artifacts
of the gate opening and closing during pauses in speech.</p>
